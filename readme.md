# IdeaCloud

**This program is currently still under development and not yet usable.**

A program where you can store your ideas, TODOs, etc. for the next time with priority, beautifully presented through a nice tag cloud (the so-called idea cloud). Just type in the idea or TODO in a single word or a few words, a weight between 1 and 15 and optionally a deadline. After confirming, IdeaCloud shows all your ideas in the idea cloud.

The words are ordered according to the input order. The size of the word in the idea cloud is shown according to the selected priorization. Multiple words with the same priorization are possible. Furthermore, a HTML page is created for each idea or TODO where this idea or TODO can be described, documents can be added, etc.
